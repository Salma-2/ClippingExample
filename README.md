# ClippingExample
Demonstrates how setting different clipping paths affects the drawing of rectangles, lines, text, and circles.

This app draws seven squares that each demonstrates a clipping region, or combination of several clipping regions, including a picture frame, circular clipping, and using a DIFFERENCE and INTERSECT operator when combining clipping regions.

The app also demonstrates how to draw transformed text on a canvas, using translation and skewing.
